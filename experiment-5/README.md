## Learning Outcomes

1. Understanding how lazy loading reduces initial bundle size by splitting components into separate chunks that load dynamically on user demand.

2. Mastering React Suspense to handle asynchronous loading and provide meaningful fallback content during component transitions.

3. Implementing route-based code splitting to optimize Single Page Applications by loading components only on navigation.
