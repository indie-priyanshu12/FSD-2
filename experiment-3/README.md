## Aim
Implement Routing in SPA

## Steps Performed

1. **Installed React Router DOM** - Added `react-router-dom` package to manage client-side routing in the application.

2. **Created SPA Component** - Developed the main `Spa.jsx` component using `BrowserRouter` to enable routing functionality.

3. **Added Navigation Links** - Implemented React Router `Link` components in the TopBar for Home, About, and Contact pages with styled navigation.

4. **Created Route Definitions** - Set up `Routes` components to map URL paths to different components.

5. **Created Component Files** - Built three page components:
   - `Home.jsx` - Home page with a form containing name and email fields
   - `About.jsx` - About page with company information form
   - `Contact.jsx` - Contact page with contact form (name, phone, message)

6. **Styled Components with CSS** - Created corresponding CSS files for each component:
   - `Spa.css` - Styling for navigation bar with links and hover effects
   - `Home.css` - Form styling for Home page
   - `About.css` - Form styling for About page
   - `Contact.css` - Form styling for Contact page

## Learning Outcomes

1. Learned how to implement single-page applications that navigate between different views without full page reloads, improving user experience.

2. Mastered the use of BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and Link components to manage navigation and URL patterns in React applications.

3. Developed skills in structuring applications with multiple reusable components and managing component-specific styling with separate CSS files.

4. Learned to style interactive navigation elements including hover effects and proper CSS selectors to target nested elements.
